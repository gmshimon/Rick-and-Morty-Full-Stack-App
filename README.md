# 🌀 Rick & Morty AI Character Explorer

A **full-stack AI-powered Rick and Morty character explorer** that integrates with the **Rick & Morty API**, supports **custom character creation**, and leverages **AI features** such as backstory generation, personality analysis, relationship predictions, and interactive character chatbots.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ **Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**

* **API Integration:** Fetch and search characters by name/species from the Rick & Morty API.
* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with middleware to protect routes.
* **Custom Character Management:**

  * Create, update, delete, and list custom characters.
  * Character fields include `name`, `species`, `status`, `gender`, `origin`, `image`, `backstory`, and ownership tracking.
* **AI Chatbot:**

  * Chat with custom or API-fetched characters.
  * AI responses mimic the **character’s personality and speech style**, leveraging **OpenAI GPT-4 streaming responses**.
  * Chat history stored for continuity.
* **Structured Logging:** Implemented `winston` + `morgan` for detailed request/response logs.
* **Error Handling:** Centralized global error middleware for clean error responses.

### ✅ **AI Features Implemented**

* **Character Backstory Integration:** Custom characters can have AI-generated backstories.
* **Character Personality Chatbot:** Users can converse with AI versions of the characters in real-time.
* **Chat History Persistence:** Previous conversations with characters are loaded and preserved.

### ✅ **Frontend (Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)** *(planned/partially implemented)*

* **Modern UI setup with Tailwind & shadcn/ui**.
* Planned pages:

  * **Character Search & Details Page**
  * **Custom Character CRUD UI**
  * **AI Chatbot Page**

### ✅ **Security & Best Practices**

* JWT verification middleware to restrict protected routes.
* CORS configured for safe API access.

## 📚 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT
* **AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4 API
* **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix components)
* **DevOps:** Winston + Morgan logging, environment-based config with dotenv

## 🔮 Planned / Future Improvements

> Since this project focuses on demonstrating the development approach, some features remain to be enhanced or added.

* **AI Enhancements**

  * Character **relationship predictor** (vector embeddings).
  * Personality profiling (Big Five Traits).
  * AI-generated episode recommendations.

* **Frontend Enhancements**

  * Full integration of character search & details UI.
  * Real-time chatbot with streaming AI responses.
  * Improved caching with Redis or ISR/SSR.

* **Production Readiness**

  * Containerization (Docker)
  * Deployment to Render/Fly.io (backend) & Vercel (frontend)
  * Unit & integration tests with Jest/Mocha

## 📝 How to Run

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # Add your MongoDB URI & OpenAI API key
npm run dev            # Start development server
```

## 💡 Notes

* Some AI features (like personality analysis & relationship prediction) are **planned but not yet implemented** for time constraints.
* A professional-grade deployment would also include **Docker, CI/CD, test coverage, and better rate limiting**.

Would you like me to:
✅ **Include a “Feature vs Implemented” checklist** in the README for clarity?
✅ Or also **add installation & usage instructions for the frontend**?

I can refine this further depending on what you want to emphasize. Should I include a **feature checklist table**?
